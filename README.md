# pi-tools

Pi-native port of the orchestrator / manager / worker / adversary agent system
from [claude-tools-library](https://github.com/eilidhmae/claude-tools-library),
adapted for `pi-coding-agent` + Ollama + qwen3-coder.

## What this is

A multi-agent hierarchy (orchestrator → managers → workers / adversaries) that
preserves the original library's authority-separation model while mapping each
component onto pi's native primitives.

| Claude Code concept             | Pi equivalent                                    |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `.claude/agents/` frontmatter   | `skills/` + `AGENTS.md`                          |
| `/adversary-review` slash cmd   | `prompts/adversary-review.md`                    |
| PostToolUse hook                | `extensions/adversary-hook.ts` (`agent_end`)     |
| `_shared.md` bootstrap          | `AGENTS.md` (auto-loaded every session)          |
| Subagent spawn (Agent tool)     | RPC subprocess via `extensions/quorum.ts`        |

## Install

### Global (all projects)

```bash
bash install.sh
```

Writes to `~/.pi/agent/`:

```
~/.pi/agent/
├── AGENTS.md
├── models.json                       # created if absent; ollama defaults
├── skills/{adversary,manager,orchestrator,worker}/SKILL.md
├── prompts/adversary-review.md
├── extensions/{adversary-hook,quorum}.ts
└── tools/{adversary-check,adversary-pass,gen-review-revise}.sh
```

### Project-local

```bash
bash install.sh --local
```

Same files, but under `.pi/agent/` in the current git repo root. Shell scripts
go to `tools/bash/` under the repo root (not inside `.pi/agent/`).

### Force overwrite

```bash
bash install.sh --force
```

## Models

Two runtime paths over the **same** underlying model — Qwen3-Coder
30B-A3B (MoE, 3B activated of 30B total, 262K context, non-thinking
mode only):

- **Existing (default)**: `qwen3-coder:30b` via Ollama. Strong
  tool-calling, no Apple-Silicon requirement.
- **New (M5 Max + Apple Silicon)**: `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b` (4-bit MLX)
  with hot-swappable LoRA adapters (`+go`, `+rust`, `+python`, `+tf`,
  `+adversary`) served via `mlx_lm.server` or MOLA on `localhost:18080`.

The harness is adapter-agnostic: model selection flows through `--model`
and `models.json`. Today's Ollama users see no behavior change.

See [`MODELS.md`](MODELS.md) for the operator entry point (where adapter
artifacts live, how to run pi with each one, dogfood procedure) and
[`model-plan.md`](model-plan.md) for the full design rationale.

`install.sh` creates `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with both providers
(ollama + local-mlx) if one does not already exist. The local-mlx
provider points at the inference server in [`server/`](server/).

## Usage

```bash
# Self-review checklist (prompt command, runs in current session)
pi /adversary-review

# Full adversary skill, read-only
pi --tools read,grep,ls,bash --no-write --no-edit /skill:adversary

# Manager- or orchestrator-coordinated session
pi /skill:manager
pi /skill:orchestrator

# Headless adversary pipeline
bash ~/.pi/agent/tools/adversary-pass.sh src/auth.go

# Adversary pass with automatic quorum on CONCERNS/FAIL
bash ~/.pi/agent/tools/adversary-pass.sh src/auth.go --quorum

# Full generate → adversary → revise cycle
bash ~/.pi/agent/tools/gen-review-revise.sh specs/feature.md --revise
```

## Key design notes

- **`AGENTS.md` is the `_shared.md` equivalent.** Pi auto-loads it from
  `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` and any project-local `.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` every
  session. It carries Startup Reads, the Mechanical Baseline, Mutation-
  Verification Safety, Enqueue-Before-Ack, and resource ceilings.
- **No `CLAUDE.md`.** Per-project context lives in `PROJECT.md`, which the
  orchestrator creates on first run. Shared rules stay in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Tool enforcement at the harness level.** The adversary skill is always
  invoked with `--no-write --no-edit`; read-only authority is mechanical, not
  just prompt convention.
- **Quorum via RPC, not shell loops.** `extensions/quorum.ts` intercepts
  CONCERNS/FAIL verdicts and spawns peer adversary sessions as pi RPC
  subprocesses — no outer shell harness required.
- **`adversary-check.sh` is unchanged** from the original library and runs
  identically via the `bash` tool.
